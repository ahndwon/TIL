# Simple Weather Card by pure CSS
This card is based on one of the examples in [Cards - Material Design](https://material.io/design/components/cards.html#Dividers) 
I tried to copy it using only CSS.

## Key Point
Because CSS doesnâ€™t support mouse click events, I made the EXPAND button by overlaying an invisible checkbox. By this way, I was able to trigger transitions similar to a button. 

Cons : But the checkbox ruins the structure because it needs to be outside of the container which it belongs to.
